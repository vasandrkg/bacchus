# Bacchus

Bacchus was the Roman god of agriculture, wine and fertility, 
equivalent to the Greek god Dionysus.

He is often seen with vines of grapes with him. 

Dionysus was said to be the last god to join the twelve Olympians.

Bacchus is the son of Jupiter.

Supposedly, Hestia gave up her seat for him. 
His plants were vines and twirling ivy. 
He carried a pine cone-topped staff, and his followers were goat-footed Satyrs 
and Maenads, wild women who danced energetically during his festivals.
